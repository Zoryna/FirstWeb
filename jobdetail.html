		<p> A <b> cognitive psychologist </b> specifically studies how people acquire, process, and store information. They also study mental processes, memory, perception, and learning </p>
		<p> I like this profession because I want to do research on the human mind, brain, and behavior through research. I want to know why and how people think differently from each other </p>
