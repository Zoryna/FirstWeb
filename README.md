# First Website

A project for my Honors Intro to Computer Science class during my senior year of high school. This was the first HTML and CSS website I developed.

## Purpose

The website was supposed to show my career plans at the time. I had to explain what I wanted to be in the future and which colleges I considered attending.

## Tech

Just a simple HTML and CSS website. I used Adobe Photoshop to create some of the images.

## Getting Started

Clone or download the repository and then double-click on the html files to view the website on a browser.
